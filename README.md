# DSCD-Project
A project in the course of Distributed Systems offered in 2023.

We have implemented all the components of the MapReduce framework without using an existing distributed computing framework such as Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark. The implementation supports the following three applications/queries:
 1. Word Count
 2. Inverted Index [Record-Level Inverted index]
 3. Natural Join
